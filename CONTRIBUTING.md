# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and accepted via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevedobe/laravel-svelte).

## Pull Requests

- **Document any behaviour change** - Make sure the `README.md` and other relevant documentation are up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
